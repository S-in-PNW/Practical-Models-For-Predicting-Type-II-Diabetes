In this analysis, we will create a predictive dataframe that demonstrates the potential for an abbreviated predictive model where key lifestyle and health indicators could be used to streamline diabetes risk assessments. This model could be used by healthcare workers to visualize the correlation between a patient's risk of developing Type II diabetes and patient information a hospital would likely already have. Ultimately, such data-driven insights can empower clinicians to offer targeted advice and interventions for those most at risk, potentially improving outcomes in diabetic care and prevention.
