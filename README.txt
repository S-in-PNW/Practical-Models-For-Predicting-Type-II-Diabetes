In this project, I developed a predictive model to assess Type II diabetes risk using key health and lifestyle indicators. By engineering and preprocessing real-world healthcare data, I applied feature scaling, Principal Component Analysis (PCA), and decision tree models to identify the most influential risk factors. I trained and evaluated various classification models, optimizing for interpretability and accuracy. The final model provides a streamlined approach to diabetes risk assessment, demonstrating how machine learning can support clinicians in making data-driven decisions. This project showcases my skills in data analysis, machine learning, and healthcare applications, reinforcing my ability to extract actionable insights from complex datasets.
