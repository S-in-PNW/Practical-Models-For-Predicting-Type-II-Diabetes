For this project, I built a predictive model to assess Type II diabetes risk using a dataset with key health and lifestyle factors. The goal was to see if we could create a simplified model that used information most primary care heathcare providers would have on-hand. I used data preprocessing techniques like feature scaling and PCA to reduce complexity, then trained decision trees and other classification models to find the strongest predictors. The results showed which factors had the highest correlation with diabetes risk, making it easier to visualize trends and potentially improve early intervention strategies.
